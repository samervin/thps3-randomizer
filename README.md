# THPS3 Randomizer

A work-in-progress randomizer for THPS3 for PC.

## Running locally

- All the QB files that ship with THPS3 are included in `/vanilla-qbs` but if you want to regenerate them, run these commands:
    - `cd qb-editor`
    - `set THPS3_DATA_FOLDER=C:/Path/To/THPS3/Data/`
    - `javac -encoding Cp1252 *.java && java -Dfile.encoding=COMPAT ReadQBFiles`
- To write the files generated by the randomizer in `/outfiles`, the process is very similar:
    - `cd qb-editor`
    - `set THPS3_DATA_FOLDER=C:/Path/To/THPS3/Data/`
    - `javac -encoding Cp1252 *.java && java -Dfile.encoding=COMPAT WriteQBFiles`

### Thanks

- byxor for helping me get started and providing information on scripting and engine functions
- Vadru and inoX for creating THQBEditor, from which much of the `/qb-editor` code comes from (with permission)
