This folder holds the .out files that are written by the Python rando scripts, then saved in QB format by the Java code.

.out files are ignored by .gitignore so this folder looks mostly empty, but it contains Levels/ and Scripts/ folders just like the vanilla-qbs directory.

The qdir.txt file is needed to replace the vanilla one, and is calibrated to read from the copied script files.
