# Competition scores

The calculation goes something like this:

- Getting the listed medal score for a level will generally give you the associated numeric ranking. 
- There is randomness in the scores the judges give you, but they will generally average to the correct ranking.
- Example:
    - If you score exactly 25k points in vanilla Rio, your ranking will be (roughly) 80.
    - If you score below 25k, you will get some percentage of 80 as your ranking.
    - If you score above 25k but below 70k (the silver) will give you a ranking between 80 and 85.
- The other skaters get randomly generated ranking assigned to them every run. 
    - One skater will be near the gold ranking
    - One skater will be near the silver ranking
    - All other skaters will be near the bronze ranking

I can't tell for the life of me what the bails number does. It doesn't seem to react to being changed or make any difference on ranking, though I could be wrong.

Vanilla requirements (these numbers are never displayed in-game):
    - Rio: bronze 80 = 25k, silver 85 = 70k, gold 90 = 120k, bail = .25
    - Skater Island: bronze 85 = 45k, silver 90 = 80k, gold 93 = 150k, bail = .35
    - Tokyo: bronze 90 = 100k, silver 92.5 = 150k, gold 95 = 200k, bail = .5
